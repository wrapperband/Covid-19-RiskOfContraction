# Covid-19-RiskOfContraction  

#### Speadsheets to calculate the risk of catching Covid-19 and how that risk is changing over time.    

I'm disabled but have made these initial charts to show people the real risk. I have done this by calculating the cumulative number of infected cases from the number of dead. 160 * Dead = Infections over last 20 days before person is tested.  

I then have shown the virus is doubling at greater than the 4 days doubling time I and others were estimating, and shorter than the Govt are working to.
